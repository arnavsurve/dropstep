        Upload my resume {{ resume }} when prompted. If there's a separate field for a cover letter, first identify
        whether this is a textinput where you can write. In that case, write a custom cover letter with
        minimal fluff based on my skills and experience tailored to the position. If this requires a file upload
        for the CV, check if it's optional. If optional, don't submit a cover letter. If a CV is required, and 
        also requires a file upload for the CV, move on to a different job application.
        
        Complete all required fields and submit the application. If there are any questions 
        about my willingness to relocate or work authorization, I am willing to relocate anywhere in North America.
        I am authorized to work in North America.
